            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>Growing up in an immigrant household instilled hard work from a young age.
                From academics to a variety of extracurriculars, overachieving had always been
                expected. However, I fell in love with programming toward the end of my high
                school career because of it's ability to challenge me. The thrill of solving
                difficult problems or program an app inspired me to follow in the footsteps of
                my mother and brother into the tech industry.

        <div class="textbox">
            <p>I was fortunate enough to grow up around a lot of opportunities while living in San Francisco.
                It was destined for me to pursue this career path with all my guidance. However, many other
                minority children children are not exposed to the same possibilities. I want to use my experience
                as a chance to unveil the tech industry to those in my Latino community. I believe exposing them
                to this field will lead to a more productive and diverse industry which will continue to flourish.
